# Architecture

## Overview

`v8-test-runner` is a Rust CLI for orchestrating local 1C platform operations. The current codebase is organized into seven main layers:

1. `cli` parses arguments, maps them into transport-neutral requests, and owns command-level text/json rendering.
2. `config` loads and validates YAML configuration.
3. `domain` defines structured result types for commands plus shared execution step structs.
4. `use_cases` owns transport-neutral requests, `ExecutionContext`, structured failures, and business orchestration.
5. `platform` contains process execution, utility discovery, connection argument building, and low-level 1C adapters.
6. `output` contains CLI presentation primitives such as `Presenter` and `Envelope`.
7. `change_detection`, `parsers`, and `support` provide shared subsystems and utilities.

## Current Platform Layer

The platform layer is intentionally split so responsibilities do not bleed into use cases:

- `platform::process` defines `ProcessRunner`, `ProcessExecutor`, `ProcessRequest`, `ProcessResult`, and `SpawnResult`.
- `platform::locator` resolves concrete executables (`1cv8`, `1cv8c`, `ibcmd`, `1cedtcli`) and caches results per `Locator` instance.
- `platform::connection` builds reusable V8 connection/auth arguments from the raw config connection string.
- `platform::utilities` is the current facade used by use cases. It owns the stateful `Locator` and exposes the standard execution path.
- `platform::designer` is the low-level batch DSL for `1cv8 DESIGNER`, returning `PlatformCommandResult` so `/Out` logs stay separate from runner-captured stdio.
- `platform::ibcmd` is the low-level DSL for `ibcmd`, returning `PlatformCommandResult` with stdout/stderr diagnostics (no `/Out` log).

This boundary is designed so Wave 2 can add an EDT-specific interactive runner without replacing the locator API or the standard execution path.

## Command Boundary

The CLI/runtime boundary is now split explicitly:

- `app.rs` owns bootstrap concerns only: config loading, logging setup, log cleanup, and top-level error envelopes for pre-command failures.
- `cli::execute` converts `clap` args into transport-neutral request structs and renders command success/failure output.
- `use_cases::{request,context,result}` define the transport-neutral contract that both CLI and future MCP adapters can consume.
- `use_cases/*.rs` no longer depend on `clap`, `Presenter`, or `Envelope`.

This keeps current CLI behavior intact while reserving a stable internal API for MCP stdio/HTTP adapters.

## Backend Dispatch

`build` and `dump` use cases dispatch by `builder`:

- `builder=DESIGNER` uses the existing `DesignerDsl`.
- `builder=IBCMD` uses `IbcmdDsl` with `config import/apply` for build and `config export` for dump.

Constraints to keep in mind:

- IBCMD requires file-based infobase connections.
- Object-level partial dump is not supported for the IBCMD backend.

## Output Flow

Use cases now return transport-neutral payloads or structured failures.

- `cli::execute` converts successful command payloads into `Envelope<T>` for JSON mode.
- `cli::execute` preserves command-specific text formatting for build, test, dump, syntax, and launch.
- Failure payload emission is also decided at the adapter boundary, which keeps `launch --output json` failure semantics unchanged while allowing other commands to keep structured JSON failures.

## Working Directories

`workPath` is the root for runtime artifacts:

- `workPath/logs/platform/` stores platform log files.
- `workPath/temp/partial-lists/` stores partial load list files.
- `workPath/temp/yaxunit/` stores temporary YaXUnit config files.
- `workPath/hash-storages/` remains reserved for change detection state.
- `workPath/<sourceSetName>/` is reserved for the future EDT export flow and is not created yet.
