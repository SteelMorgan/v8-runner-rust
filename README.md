# v8-runner

`v8-runner` is a Rust CLI and MCP server for local 1C development workflows. It gives a single
entrypoint for building source sets into an infobase, validating changes, running tests, dumping
state back to files, materializing release artifacts, converting between `DESIGNER` and `EDT`,
launching 1C tools, and exposing a narrower MCP tool surface for agents.

## Overview

- Main user loop: `build -> syntax/test -> diagnose`.
- Source formats: `DESIGNER` and `EDT`.
- Builder backends: `DESIGNER` and `IBCMD` where the command contract allows it.
- Machine-readable CLI output: `--json-message`.
- MCP `structured_content` uses the same command envelope core as CLI JSON.

## Quick Start

Build the binary:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Create a starter config in the current repository:

```bash
./target/release/v8-runner config init
```

Run the usual local loop:

```bash
./target/release/v8-runner init
./target/release/v8-runner build
./target/release/v8-runner syntax designer-modules --server
./target/release/v8-runner test yaxunit all
```

Start MCP transport when needed:

```bash
./target/release/v8-runner mcp serve stdio
```

If `config init` is not enough for your repository layout, use
[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) to author `v8project.yaml` manually.
